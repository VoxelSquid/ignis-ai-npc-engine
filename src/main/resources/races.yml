  race-description: "Possessing fangs and brute strength, but lacking in cunning, they are formidable warriors, resilient and towering. Their language is simple, bold and honest. Sometimes they use phrases from the Orcish language that only they understand (from the World of Warcraft). Though often perceived as savage barbarians, orcs hold tradition in high regard and revere martial honor and spiritual shamanism, bound by a profound sense of community. Adapted to the rigors of the desert, they are invariably found beneath the relentless sun. Orcs are, to some, dangerous and powerful enemies, while to others, they are steadfast companions in arms."

  race-description: "The Mandrati are a race of intelligent ape-like humanoids inhabiting dense jungles. Their fur-covered bodies and long arms make them skilled climbers, effortlessly navigating tree canopies. Their society is matriarchal, with wise female elders leading tribes according to ancient traditions and a deep connection to nature. Known for their agility, strength, and cunning, the Mandrati inspire both awe and fear in those who trespass into their domain. They possess a unique language of vocalizations and gestures, and their shamans commune with forest spirits. While generally peaceful, they fiercely defend their territory from outsiders. Their language barely resembles human language and so everything they say sounds very primitive and strange. They hardly understand what being polite means, they are beasts after all."
